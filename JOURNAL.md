## 10/6/2025 - Completed My Side Desk Display üòÅ  

This is my frst hardware project on HackClub , I'm new to all this work and got the idea to make this by ChatGPT , i started this project on 3rd October and ended on 5th October. I didn't knew abt blueprint then so i didn't made any sort of journal entry here and this is my last entry . As i'm new to pcb designing and CAD so this project took lot of efforts and also it was amazing experience . üòÉ![Capture.PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--adc05a610ff47f45f1e6beeb5dfe381d23b7fac7/Capture.PNG)

## 10/24/2025 10:44 PM - Designing The Schematic   

The next day i.e. 4th October was a lot time taking , that day i did all the schematic and routing of the PCB and finished the PCB work , it was quite easy though took time due to my potato pc . Also i got some time to make the GitHub so also did that the same day . It was my frst project so it took a way too much time and i was frustrated but at last completed the PCB  ![486140310-4fa1b555-9b31-456c-961b-bd571af451a6.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTE2NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8299a0299a53de8b138dda4ca8a3aac0e4876053/486140310-4fa1b555-9b31-456c-961b-bd571af451a6.png)
