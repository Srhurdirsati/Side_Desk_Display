## 10/6/2025 - Completed My Side Desk Display üòÅ  

This is my frst hardware project on HackClub , I'm new to all this work and got the idea to make this by ChatGPT , i started this project on 3rd October and ended on 5th October. I didn't knew abt blueprint then so i didn't made any sort of journal entry here and this is my last entry . As i'm new to pcb designing and CAD so this project took lot of efforts and also it was amazing experience . üòÉ![Capture.PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--adc05a610ff47f45f1e6beeb5dfe381d23b7fac7/Capture.PNG)
